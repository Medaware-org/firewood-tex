\section{Market}
At this point, it might be worth to take a closer look at the market that we're dealing with.
\subsection{Competition}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{BIC} --- Undoubtedly, the company most often associated with modern disposable lighters.
		Whilst the production of disposable devices is not the main focus of {\fw}, it is their innovative
		wooden design that ultimately renders this outcome inevitable. The average price of a \textbf{BIC} sits
		at a unit price of around $1.50$\euro. With an estimated production price of $0.25${\euro} per unit,
		the lighters come at a sale margin of approximately $83\%$ (= $\frac{1.5 - 0.25}{1.5} \cdot 100$) and
		come at a great turnover rate.
	\item \textbf{Zippo} --- Unlike the former, \textbf{Zippo} focues on more premium market, with higher-quality
		products designed with longevity in mind. Fittingly, the price of the company's lighters aligns with the
		premium philosophy. With the lower-end prices at about $25${\euro} and the high-end peaking
		at just below $500${\euro}, the company provides a very wide spectrum of products for various types of
		customers.
\end{itemize}
It is important to note that, due to the philosophical differences between the two companies, their businesses do not
necessarily interfere with each other. Meanwhile, it would seem that {\fw} falls right inbetween the two companies,
putting itself in an unlikely spot to succeed.
